@article{Leichtle2017,
abstract = {Monitoring of changes is one of the most important inherent capabilities of remote sensing. The steadily increasing amount of available very-high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery requires highly automatic methods and thus, largely unsupervised concepts for change detection. In addition, new procedures that address this challenge should be capable of handling remote sensing data acquired by different sensors. Thereby, especially in rapidly changing complex urban environments, the high level of detail present in VHR data indicates the deployment of object-based concepts for change detection. This paper presents a novel object-based approach for unsupervised change detection with focus on individual buildings. First, a principal component analysis together with a unique procedure for determination of the number of relevant principal components is performed as a predecessor for change detection. Second, k-means clustering is applied for discrimination of changed and unchanged buildings. In this manner, several groups of object-based difference features that can be derived from multi-temporal VHR data are evaluated regarding their discriminative properties for change detection. In addition, the influence of deviating viewing geometries when using VHR data acquired by different sensors is quantified. Overall, the proposed workflow returned viable results in the order of $\kappa$ statistics of 0.8–0.9 and beyond for different groups of features, which demonstrates its suitability for unsupervised change detection in dynamic urban environments. With respect to imagery from different sensors, deviating viewing geometries were found to deteriorate the change detection result only slightly in the order of up to 0.04 according to $\kappa$ statistics, which underlines the robustness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In the performance of change detection analysis, the change/unchanged pixel categorization is usually made through empirical methods or trial-and-error manual procedures whose reliability may affect the results. To detect land-cover changes, an unsupervised change detection technique was applied to Landsat images from an area in the south of M{\'{e}}xico. At first, normalized surface reflectance, principal components, and tasselled cap images were used to develop the chi-square transformation (CST) applied to each kind of image organized in absolute and relative values and thus, obtain the continuous image of change. Later, the histogram secant technique was applied to change images to automatically define the thresholds and categorize as change/unchanged the pixels. Finally, to assess the change detection accuracy, 86 polygons (14,512 pixels) were sampled, classified as real change/unchanged sites, and defined as ground-truth, from the interpretation of color aerial photo slides aided by the land-cover maps to obtain omission/commission errors and kappa coefficient of agreement. The results show that the CST and automatic histogram secant thresholding are suitable techniques that can be applied for unsupervised analysis change detection.},

abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30{\%} relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3{\%}. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/{\~{}}rbg/rcnn.},

abstract = {Monitoring the locations and distributions of land-cover changes is important for establishing links between policy decisions, regulatory actions and subsequent land-use activities. Past studies incorporating two-date change detection using Landsat data have tended to be performance limited for applications in biologically complex systems. This study explored the use of 250 m multi-temporal MODIS NDVI 16-day composite data to provide an automated change detection and alarm capability on a 1 year time-step for the Albemarle–Pamlico Estuary System (APES) region of the US. Detection accuracy was assessed for 2002 at 88{\%}, with a reasonable balance between change commission errors (21.9{\%}), change omission errors (27.5{\%}), and Kappa coefficient of 0.67. Annual change detection rates across the APES over the study period (2002–2005) were estimated at 0.7{\%} per annum and varied from 0.4{\%} (2003) to 0.9{\%} (2004). Regional variations were also readily apparent ranging from 1.6{\%} to 0.1{\%} per annum for the tidal water and mountain ecological zones, respectfully. This research included the application of an automated protocol to first filter the MODIS NDVI data to remove poor (corrupted) data values and then estimate the missing data values using a discrete Fourier transformation technique to provide high-quality uninterrupted data to support the change detection analysis. The methods and results detailed in this article apply only to non-agricultural areas. Additional limitations attributed to the coarse resolution of the NDVI data included the overestimation of change area that necessitated the application of a change area correction factor.},

abstract = {The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at minimal additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251{\%}, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of {\~{}}25{\%}.

Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.},

abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of scene parsing with deep learning and focus on the context aggregation strategy for robust segmentation. Motivated by that the label of a pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs to, we introduce an $\backslash$emph{\{}object context pooling (OCP){\}} scheme, which represents each pixel by exploiting the set of pixels that belong to the same object category with such a pixel, and we call the set of pixels as object context. Our implementation, inspired by the self-attention approach, consists of two steps: (i) compute the similarities between each pixel and all the pixels, forming a so-called object context map for each pixel served as a surrogate for the true object context, and (ii) represent the pixel by aggregating the features of all the pixels weighted by the similarities. The resulting representation is more robust compared to existing context aggregation schemes, e.g., pyramid pooling modules (PPM) in PSPNet and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), which do not differentiate the context pixels belonging to the same object category or not, making the reliability of contextually aggregated representations limited. We empirically demonstrate our approach and two pyramid extensions with state-of-the-art performance on three semantic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, ADE20K and LIP.

abstract = {The use of satellite imagery has become increasingly popular for disaster monitoring and response. After a disaster, it is important to prioritize rescue operations, disaster response and coordinate relief efforts. These have to be carried out in a fast and efficient manner since resources are often limited in disaster-affected areas and it's extremely important to identify the areas of maximum damage. However, most of the existing disaster mapping efforts are manual which is time-consuming and often leads to erroneous results. In order to address these issues, we propose a framework for change detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on satellite images which can then be thresholded and clustered together into grids to find areas which have been most severely affected by a disaster. We also present a novel metric called Disaster Impact Index (DII) and use it to quantify the impact of two natural disasters - the Hurricane Harvey flood and the Santa Rosa fire. Our framework achieves a top F1 score of 81.2{\%} on the gridded flood dataset and 83.5{\%} on the gridded fire dataset.},

abstract = {The Jaccard index, also referred to as the intersection-over-union score, is commonly employed in the evaluation of image segmentation results given its perceptual qualities, scale invariance - which lends appropriate relevance to small objects, and appropriate counting of false negatives, in comparison to per-pixel losses. We present a method for direct optimization of the mean intersection-over-union loss in neural networks, in the context of semantic image segmentation, based on the convex Lov$\backslash$'asz extension of submodular losses. The loss is shown to perform better with respect to the Jaccard index measure than the traditionally used cross-entropy loss. We show quantitative and qualitative differences between optimizing the Jaccard index per image versus optimizing the Jaccard index taken over an entire dataset. We evaluate the impact of our method in a semantic segmentation pipeline and show substantially improved intersection-over-union segmentation scores on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets using state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation architectures.},

abstract = {We present a technique for adding global context to deep convolutional networks for semantic segmentation. The approach is simple, using the average feature for a layer to augment the features at each location. In addition, we study several idiosyncrasies of training, significantly increasing the performance of baseline networks (e.g. from FCN). When we add our proposed global feature, and a technique for learning normalization parameters, accuracy increases consistently even over our improved versions of the baselines. Our proposed approach, ParseNet, achieves state-of-the-art performance on SiftFlow and PASCAL-Context with small additional computational cost over baselines, and near current state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation with a simple approach.

abstract = {Recent state-of-the-art performance on human-body pose estimation has been achieved with Deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). Traditional ConvNet architectures include pooling and sub-sampling layers which reduce computational requirements, introduce invariance and prevent over-training. These benefits of pooling come at the cost of reduced localization accuracy. We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient `position refinement' model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation. We show that the variance of our detector approaches the variance of human annotations on the FLIC dataset and outperforms all existing approaches on the MPII-human-pose dataset.},

@article{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call "cardinality" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online.},
